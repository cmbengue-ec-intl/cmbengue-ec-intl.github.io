## Midlatitude Storm Tracks and Climate Change

**Q: What are midlatitude storm tracks?**
A: Midlatitude storm tracks are regions with the most intense extratropical cyclones and anticyclones. Storm tracks are important because most poleward energy and angular momentum transport in midlatitudes occurs there. Put another way, the storm tracks control the weather and climate of Earth's mid-latitudes.

**Q: How will climate change affect storm tracks?**
A: The storm-track response to climate change is complex; for example, the response varies by season (or timescale) and location. Nonetheless, there is agreement among climate models of varying complexity that the mean storm-track position in each hemisphere will shift towards its respective pole as the climate warms in response to increases in greenhouse gases.

**Q: Why should we care about changes in the storm tracks?**
A: Changes in the storm tracks have broad implications for water availability, energy production, and severe weather patterns in mid-latitudes.

### Summary of Storm Track Research

Although the storm-track response to climate change is important, the dynamics underpinning storm-track shifts still need to be better understood. Therefore, we seek to understand what controls storm-track shifts. To answer this question, we use models of varying complexity to test and develop theories of storm-track changes. To that end, we have demonstrated that deep-tropical forcing can shift storm tracks and that dry dynamics explain a substantial proportion of storm-track shifts (Mbengue and Schneider, 2013). Further progress was made when we used a novel method to show that changes in near-surface meridional temperature gradients dominate storm-track shifts (Mbengue and Schneider, 2017a). These results are corroborated by the results of the recently published work (Baker et al., 2017). Building on these results, we develop a simple conceptual model that shows how convection in the tropics can lead to storm-track shifts, especially in circumstances where changes in deep tropical convective stability suffice to shift the storm tracks.

(left) Mean zonal wind (black contours), eddy momentum flux divergence (filled contours; yellow is positive), and tropopause [thick red line, World Meteorological Organization (WMO) criterion]. (right) Potential temperature (black contours), mass flux streamfunction (blue contours). Compare (a) with (c) for the response to tropical convective stability changes and (a) with (b) for the response to global convective stability changes. The circles show the location of the storm tracks as indicated by extrema in barotropic eddy kinetic energy (red), meridional eddy potential temperature flux (green), vertical heat flux (cyan), and surface westerlies (black).
