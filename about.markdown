Hi! I am Cheikh. And welcome to my personal website.

I live in the Caribbean on [Saint Lucia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia) island. 

I work as the lead Engineering Scientist at [Elizabeth Consulting International Inc](https://www.ec-intl.com). Also, I am the project manager and model products lead at the [Climate Modeling Alliance](https://clima.caltech.edu).
