# Hello, I'm Cheikh Mbengue 👋

## About Me

I live in the Caribbean on [Saint Lucia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia) island. While I wouldn't call myself a technophile, I enjoy seeking and employing new technology to improve my environment.

I am the lead Research and Engineering Scientist at [Elizabeth Consulting International Inc.](https://www.ec-intl.com). Also, I'm the Project Manager and Model Products lead at the [Climate Modeling Alliance](https://clima.caltech.edu) (CliMA), where I focus on delivering value through well-structured and efficiently managed projects. My mission at CliMA is to provide a much-needed, world-class ESM and to develop the tools to decimate the data and insights derived from it. Over the years, I've worked on various projects in sectors like software development, business process automation and optimization, and FinTech.

🔭 **Currently Working On:**

- Managing the development of the CliMA ESM
- A web application to deliver design condition information to planners and engineers
- Managing the development of small business management and optimization software solutions
- Integrating AI into management and delivery processes

🌱 **Learning:**

- Ruby and Ruby on Rails
- To upgrade my cloud integration and deployment skills

👯 **Looking to Collaborate on:**

- Projects to deliver actionable climate information to a diversity of users
- Projects to develop frontend apps that deliver weather and climate intelligence

🎓 **Fun Fact:**

- I earned free fall skydiving wings from the U.S. Air Force Academy
